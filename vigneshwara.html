            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lord Ganesha is the Hindu God (Deity) who is believed to be the Lord of new beginnings therefore, he is worshipped at the start of all Hindu religious ceremonies. He is the Lord of letters and is associated with intellectualism. Hence, he is the patron of authors, bankers, scholars and the like. He is also called 'Vighnaharta' ie. the remover of obstacles.<br><br> 

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whereas, deep research of holy Vedas and pious Bhagavad Gita and other scriptures provides evidence that the whole universe is created by Aadi Ganesha who is immortal? He is the destroyer of sins. (Yajurved Adhyay 8 Mantra 13) He is the remover of obstacles. He is the supreme Lord who is worthy to be worshipped. (Yajurved Adhyay 5 Mantra 32) <br><br>
            
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This raises a question in the mind of devotees when Aadi Ganesha is Almighty then why do people worship demigods? Is Aadi Ganesha different from Lord Ganesha? Let us try to understand who is Aadi Ganesh? Who is a worshipable God? <br><br>  Let us proceed to get an answer based on the following questions

        <h1>2. How was Lord Ganesha created?</h1>

        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;According to shiva puran Lord Shiva had a lot of 'Gana' who respected all his orders but Goddess Parvati does not have any 'Gana'. once, when Goddess Parvati Ji was taking a bath she created a mannequin with the sandle wood paste applied on her body during bath and with her power, she breathed life into that human-form mannequin and a boy was born whom she named 'Ganesha'. She strictly instructed him to not allow anyone to enter her premises unless she has completed her bath.<br><br> 
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meanwhile, Shiv Ji returned after completing austerity from the Himalayas and tried to enter inside the palace of Parvati but Ganesh Ji was adamant in keeping the words of his mother. On facing resistance from Ganesha, out of ignorance and rage Shiva beheaded Ganesha with his trident and entered into the house.<br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Parvati Ji saw her son had died she revealed the fact how was Lord Ganesha created to Shiv Ji. She got furious and took the form of Kaali. She was all set to destroy the creation if the life of her son Ganesha is not restored. Fearful Lord Shiva revealed his helplessness to restore the severed head since the impact of his trident cannot be reversed. Then, Lord Shiva requested Lord Vishnu to help, vishnu ji told to nandhi who is vahana of shiva to bring the head of the first creature he sees on the way, who is away from his mother. <br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;nandhi ji brought the head of an elephant's head. Shiv Ji put his head atop the body of Ganesha. In this way, he was resurrected. Then Ganesha was blessed with many powers by deities present there and also, that he will be worshipped the first in any and all puja's. Since then he is called 'Gajanan' and the Lord of new beginnings.

        <h1>3. Why could Lord Shiva not Restore Lord Ganesha's original head?</h1>

        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The readers would be surprised to know that Lord Shiva could not restore Lord Ganesha's original head because his spiritual powers are limited. After Ganesha's head was severed it was piled to ash. The impact of his trident cannot be reversed. He could not roll back his destruction. This is the rule of nature. These triple Gods are bound with the Supreme God's law (Law of Aadi Ganesha). They can only provide work done. They cannot change anything. Shrimad Devi Bhagwat, Durga Puran provides evidence.

        <h1>4. Intelligence of kartikeya and ganesha story</h1>

        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ganesha had a brother whose name was Kartikeya. Ganesha was very clever and sweet natured,where as Kartikeya was very short tempered Both of them used to play on the mountains and sometimes they used to quarrel. So once they had a very big quarrel and each of them thought that the other one was guilty. The matter could not be settled. Finally they soon approached their parents to get justice. Lord Shiva and maa Parvati heard both the sides and then narada maharshi(who carries news and enlightening wisdom) was seeing this issue from a side given an idea to lord Shiva and maa Parvati and they aggred for this and lord shiva told to children narada maharshi's idea that,"let us settle it this way you have to go around the world and one who comes back first will be considered to be the right one the other one wrong ! Do you agree?" "yes ! Yes !! Agreed both of them Kartikeya always rode a peacock and was very fast at it while Ganesha used a little rat for riding. Kartikeya was sure that he would win the race because his peacock was much faster than the rat. Kartikeya immidiately jumped on his peacock and rode very fast as he could.<br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ganesha first had a look at his big stomach and then at his little rat. He was sure that he can never win the race.Then Kartikeya was already away with his peacock. And Ganesha just sat down there thinking and suddenly he had a bright idea. He made lord Shiva and mata Parvati sit together and quickly went arround them three times. Soon. Kartikeya came on his peacock after travelling arround the world successfully and told Shiva-Parvati proudly," here I come ! I won and looked at Ganesha "No,"said Ganesha,firmly,"our parents are the mother and father of the world,so going arround them is just like going arround the world! I have done it three times but you have done it only once and that makes me the winner! And Ganesha looked at lord Shiva and Parvati,"am I right or wrong?"he asked them. "Ganesha is right",said Parvati to Kartikeya," he has won the race ! " Hearing that Kartikeya lost his temper and thought that mother was partial to Ganesha. In a feat of anger he took an oath,"I shall neither look at my mother's, nor any woman's face in the world ! "and Kartikeya kept his word,he never looked at the face of any women in the world.So,in many temples of kartikeya,women do not enter.

        <h1>5. Lord Ganesha's Marriage :</h1>

        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;According to one tradition, Ganesha was a brahmacarin, that is, unmarried. This pattern is primarily popular in southern India . This tradition was linked to Hindu concepts of the relationship between celibacy and the development of spiritual power. In the north of India , on the other hand, Ganesha is often portrayed as married to the two daughters of Brahma: Buddhi ((also called Riddhi) intellect) and Siddhi (spiritual power).<br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a child Lord Ganesh was once playing with a cat. He pulled its tail and rolled it on the ground. Later, tired of this game, He decided to spend time with His mother, Parvati. He found her covered in dirt and with bruises. Surprised, He asked, “What happened, Mother?” “Remember the cat you were playing with… that was me. I am the Divine power that is exists in all beings.” Lord Ganesh realised that all women are extensions of His mother and decided never to marry.<br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another interpretation is that His devotion towards His mother is the reason why He is considered as a celibate bachelor. To Him, she was the most beautiful and a perfect woman. He vowed that He could marry the girl who would match up to His mother's beauty and divine qualities.It is said that Lord Ganesh was unable to find a suitable mate because of His unique appearance. This bothered Him and He summoned the rats to burrow deep holes in the path of any God who were on their way to get married. The potholes made the journey of the grooms and their
            marriage processions extremely difficult. Frustrated, they went to Lord Brahma to complain. Lord Brahma created two beautiful girls Riddhi (Abundance. Opulence, Wealth) and Siddhi / Buddhi (Intellectual and Spiritual Prowess) and they were married to Him. With His two consorts, He had sons Shubha (Auspiciousness) and Labha (Profit) and a daughter named Santoshi (Goddess of Satisfaction / Contentment).<br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Shiva Purana states that King Prajapati had two daughters - Riddhi and Siddhi. He approached Shiva and Parvati for the marriage of his girls to Lord Ganesh and Lord Kartikeyan / Karthikeyan(Lord Ganesh's younger brother). But both these girls wished that Lord Ganesh should be their husband and so they were married. It is said that if one has Riddhi but doesn't have Siddhi / Buddhi then it is worthless. Possessing only Siddhi without Riddhi is also futile. Lord Ganesh bestows both these blessings to His ardent devotees. If we delve into ourselves
            we will realize that we are all Ganapatis (Gana is our body made of the Pancha-Mahabhuta (Five elements), Pati stands for master or owner). Thus He shows us the way to achieve both intellect and wealth to enjoy a rewarding life.<br><br>

            The whole family tree of lord ganesha is<br> 
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;parents : lord shiva and maa Parvati,<br> 
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;brother : Karthikeya,<br> 
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;wife's: Riddhi & Siddhi,<br> 
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;son's: shubh & labha,<br> 
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;daughter: santoshi,<br> 
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;wife's of two sons: thushti & pushti,<br> 
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;grandson's: aanandhudu & pramodhudu

        <h1>6. Tulsi Cursed By Ganesha</h1>

        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tulsi (an herb from the basil family) was a beautiful maiden who, when she saw the resplendent Ganesha, fell in love with him and wished to marry him. Ganesha though, was a confirmed bachelor (at least according to some legends) and refused to oblige her. The enraged Tulsi cursed him that one day, he would indeed break his vow of celibacy. Ganesha cursed her in return, that she would marry a demon and later, turn into a plant. Tulsi realized her folly and pleaded for mercy until Ganesha relented. “You will be the most fragrant plant of all”, Ganesha said, “one that will please all the gods.
            Your leaves will be used especially in the worship of Vishnu. But you will never be present where I am worshiped.”

        <h1>7. Ganesha defeats Gana</h1>

        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Vinayaka or Gananayaka is another name for Ganesha. Gananayaka is the lord of Ganas or one who defeats Gana. A beautiful son named Gana was born to the King Abhijit and queen Gunavati. He was very bright and strong. He was a great devotee of Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva, pleased with his devotion granted him some boons(offers (varas)). However, this increased Gana's ego. He soon fell into bad company. One day he visited sage Kapila's ashram. Kapila had a gem called Chintamani that was wish fulfilling and could provide food for thousands.<br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Gana saw this, he wanted to possess the gem. Kapila did not want to give it to him. But Gana forcibly took it away from him. Kapila prayed to Lord Ganesha. Ganesha appeared in Gana's dream and cut off his head. Gana, on waking up, did not repent but became angry and took his army to kill Kapila. Gana's father, Abhijit, pleaded with Gana to give Kapila back his gem but Gana did not heed the advice. However, on reaching Kapila's ashram he found that Ganesha is theere with anger. In a fierce fight, Gana was killed by Ganesha and Ganesha restored the " Chintamani " to Kapila. Kapila, however, gave it back to Ganesha saying that
            even a small gem like this could cause trouble, as wealth is the root of many problems in this world. Kapila requested Ganesha to stay back. From then on, this place (Theur near Pune) was called 'Chintamani Vinayaka'.

        <h1>8. Moon Deity Cursed By Ganesha</h1>

        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was on Ganesha Chaturthi.Ganesha was riding on his little rat and suddenly a snake crossed his path.The rat was terrified and ran off in fright due to which Ganesha fell down in a thorny bush. The Moon was looking at this from the sky.the Moon laughed loudly at the funny sight of Ganesha's falling down,It annoyed Ganesha so much so that he decided to punish the Moon. Angrily he broke one of his tusks and threw it at the Moon. As it struck the Moon,Moon lost the brightness.Then the moon went off. The world became dark.People were scared and they screamed and wept. All the Gods in heaven were worried by this confusion.They prayed to Ganesha," please give back the Moon
           the brightness, "The Moon also repented. The Moon fell at Ganesh's feet and prayed to be forgiven. Ganesha relented but he wanted to teach Moon a lesson.So he said, "the first fifteen days of every month,you will get bigger and then the next fifteen days,you will become smaller and smaller. At the end of the month you will look like my tusk.And on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi the person who looks at the Moon will have an allegation of theft on him.

        <h1>9. The Curse of the Moon : Other Story</h1>

        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is said that anyone who looks at the moon on the night of the Ganesh Chaturthi will be falsely accused. If someone inadvertently sees the moon on this night, he/she may remedy the situation by listening to (or reciting) the story of the syamantaka jewel found in the 'Puranas' or ancient Hindu scriptures. Briefly we'll discuse about it, Satrajit, who secured a jewel syamantaka from Surya, did not part with it even when Krishna the Lord of Dwaraka, asked for it saying it would be safe with him. Prasena, the brother of Satrajit went out hunting wearing the jewel but was killed by a lion. Jambavan of the Ramayana fame killed the lion and gave it to his son to play with.
            When Prasena did not return, Satrajit falsely accused Krishna of killing Prasena for the sake of the jewel. Krishna, in order to remove the stain on his reputation, set out in search of the jewel and found it in Jambavan's cave, with his child.<br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jambavan attacked Krishna thinking him to be an intruder who had come to take away the jewel. They fought each other for 28 days, when Jambavan, his whole body terribly weakened from the hammering of Krishna's fists, finally recognized Him as Lord Rama. As a repentance for his having fought Krishna, Jambavan gave Krishna the jewel and also his daughter Jambavati in marriage. Krishna returned to Dvaraka with Jambavati and the jewel, and returned it to Satrajit, who in turn repented for his false accusation. He promptly offered to give Krishna the jewel and his daughter Satyabhama in marriage. Krishna accepted Satyabhama as his wife but did not accept the jewel.

        <h1>10. Kubera's pride takes a fall</h1>

        <p>
           &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We should never take undue pride in our material or spiritual accomplishments. The old saying "Pride always leads to a fall." is proved true in the following story. Kubera (the God of wealth) invited Shiva and Parvati to dinner wishing to show off his riches. But, the couple denied Kubera's request and said that he could feed Ganesha instead. Kubera laughed and said 'I can feed thousands of children like this." Ganesha went to his palace and sat down to eat. He started eating all the food placed in front of him. As was the custom, more and more food was served to him, as he did not say that he had enough. Soon there was no more food in the palace and so Kubera ordered his troops to get more food from the surrounding villages. But Ganesha continued eating and there was no more food to be found. Still very hungry, Ganesha started eating all the furniture. Kubera became very frightened.<br><br>
           &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ganesha told him, " You promised my parents you will feed me. Now, I have to eat you up as I am still very hungry ". Kubera ran away and pleaded with Shiva to save him from Ganesha. Shiva asked Kubera to give up his pride and serve Ganesha a handful of rice. Kubera went back to his palace. By this time, Ganesha's stomach had become very huge but the child was still hungry. When Kubera served a cup of rice with humility, Ganesha's hunger was satisfied. This teaches the lesson that handful of puffed rice given with love and eaten with devotion is more important and filling than all the wealth of kubera flaunted to impress the world and all the gods.

        <h1>11. Vinayaka wrote the Mahabharatham</h1>

        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sage Vyasa was meditating in the Himalayas. Lord Brahma appeared before him and asked him to write the Mahabharatham for the benefit of all. Sage Vyasa said that he could not compose the verse and write it down too and therefore asked for the help of someone wise, who would write down as he sang. Brahma asked sage Vyasa to pray to Lord Ganesha to help him. Ganesha told Vyasa that he had enormous work to do and hence he would write it down, only if Vyasa was quick in singing it. For his turn, Sage Vyasa requested that Ganesha should understand the meaning of the verse and only then put it down in writing. Vyasa started singing. Whenever he felt Ganesha was writing too fast for him, he would come with a difficult verse, thus by the time Ganesha could decipher the meaning, he would have composed several more verses in his mind. In this way, Vyasa completed the Bharatham in 60 lakhs granthams.<br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This comprises the Kandapuranam, Ramayanam, Savithri Puranam, Nala Puranam and so on. Lord Ganesha wrote on Mount Meru using his tusk. Of these 60 lakh granthams, 30 lakhs are supposed to be in the Deva Logam, 15 lakhs in Yatcha Logam and 14 lakhs in Asura Logam. Only the remaining 1 lakh granthams is assumed to be on the earth. Sage Vyasa is supposed to have sung 8,800 granthams, which were difficult for Ganesha to decipher. He has himself stated that Ganesha, Sage Vyasa himself and his Sugan are probably the only ones who know the meaning of those 8,800 granthams. The Mahabharatham is considered the fifth Veda.

        <h1>12. Vakradhunda Vinayaka</h1>

        <p>
           &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Basmasuran was killed by Siva & Vishnu (Vishnu in the form of Mohini), Duraasadan, Basmasuran's son was angry and upset. He did tapas & got boons from Siva that he should never die and that all the devas should be under his control, etc. As usual Siva gave him the varam & there was total chaos for some time. All the Devas ran into hiding & even Brahma & Vishnu ran out of their Brahma Logam & Vaikundam. All of them rushed to Kasi which was ruled by Viswanathar. On hearing of this Duraasadan came to Kasi. All the Gods and Devas rushed away to Kedaram, because the time was not yet right to kill Duraasadan. Soon, on the prayers of the Devas, an avataram of Lord Ganesha came out of Uma Devi's face. (with five faces, 10 hands, Jada magudam with moon). Uma Devi named him Vakradhundar and gave him her Simha Vahanam (lion). There ensued a heavy fight between Vakradhundar & Duraasadan. Finally Ganesha took a huge form (Viswa roopam)<br><br>
           &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;& placed his feet on Duraasandan's head. Since Ganesha is the form of Gnanam, all evil thoughts & the effects of his evil deeds rushed out of Duraasadan. Lord Ganesha gave him the job of destroying all evil in Kasi. He remains under Vakradhundar's feet doing his duty.

        <h1>13. Myth Behind Ekadanta</h1>

        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Have you ever wondered why Lord Ganesha has only one tusk? May be most of us haven't even noticed this all the while. Well if you are still wondering why there's only one tusk on the idol, then read on for some interesting stories behind Ganesha having one tusk. Ekadanta is a form of Lord Ganesha where He is shown having a single tusk. This form of Ganapati finds mention in the Mudgala Purana of Hinduism. 'Ekadanta' means 'single tooth'. It is believed that Ekadanta is Lord Ganesha's 22nd form out of His 32 forms. The Lord took this form to eradicate Madasura, the demon of arrogance. Myth Behind Ekadanta There are a few popular mythical stories behind the origin of the Ekadanta form of Lord Ganesha. Let's have a look at each one of them:<br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;According to the Padma Purana, once Lord Shiva's ardent devotee, Parashuram went to meet Him in Kailash. Since, Lord Shiva was busy meditating, Lord Ganesha prevented Parashuram from entering the abode. Parshuram is known for his anger in Hindu mythology. So, when Lord Ganesha stopped him at the gate, Parashuram became furious and attacked the Lord with his axe. Seeing the axe, Lord Ganesha realised that it was gifted to Parashuram by Lord Shiva. So, He refrained from blocking the attack of the axe and allowed it to chop off one of his tusks. Thus, Ganesha came to be known as Ekadanta. Later Parashuram realised his fault and asked for forgiveness from Lord Shiva, Goddess Parvati and Lord Ganesha. Another myth about Ekadanta goes like this.<br><br> 
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once Lord Ganesha was returning from a feast, where He had consumed a large number of laddoos and modaks. While He was returning on His mount, the mouse named Krauncha, a snake came their way. On seeing the snake, the mouse dropped Lord Ganesha and fled away. As a result, Ganesha's belly burst open and all the sweets came out. But Ganesha gathered all the sweets and put them back in His belly. Then He tied the snake around His belly to hold it together. Seeing this incident, the moon (Chandra) burst out laughing. Lord Ganesha became angry on seeing the moon laughing. So, he broke one of His tusks and hurdled it at the moon and cursed it that the moon will never be able to shine in its full glory. Later the moon asked for forgiveness and Lord Ganesha removed the curse from the moon. So, this is how He came to be known as the Ekadanta. ("This incident is also the reason why people refrain from seeing the moon on the night of Ganesh Chaturthi").<br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is yet another story which says that Lord Ganesha used one of His tusks as a pen to write down the epic of Mahabharata when He acted as a scribe for Ved Vyasa.<br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Ekadanta Ganapati is portrayed with a large, stomach, dark complexion, four arms and a broken tusk. It is said that if you worship Ekadanta form of Ganesha, you can achieve success in whatever work you do and improve concentration in your work. The broken tusk of the Lord signifies that He will sacrifice anything to grant the wishes of His devotees. So, worship the Ekadanta with pure devotion and He will fulfill all your wishes.

        <h1>14. Story of Ganesha as Gajanana and Lobhasura</h1>

        <P>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gajanana is one of the eight avatars of Ganesha as per the Mudgala Purana. It is stated in the Mudgala Purana that one of the mission of the Gajanana Avatar was to annihilate Lobhasura - the demon greed. Kubera, the treasurer of wealth, once visited Shiva and Goddess Parvati. Pleased with the devotion of Kubera, Shiva blessed him with the vision of the divine couple whenever he wanted. After the blessing Kubera made it a point to have the vision of divine couple daily. Soon Kubera was enamored by the beauty of Goddess Parvati and he gazed Her with lustful thoughts. Goddess Parvati who realized this gave an angry look at Kubera. Kubera was trembling in fear at the look of the Goddess and from the fear was born the demon named Lobhasura.<br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lobhasura did penance and propitiated Shiva. He was granted the boon of fearlessness. The spiritual strength and lack of fear made Lobhasura powerful and he became to the ruler of the three worlds. Power made the asura corrupt and he led a demonic life killing and looting innocents. Fed up with Lobhasura, people approached Sage Raibhya. He instructed them to offer prayers to Ganesha in Gajanana form. Gajanana was pleased with the devotion of the people and decided to annihilate the demon. Ganesha did not want war and destruction. So He asked Vishnu to apprise Lobhasura of the strength of Gajanana. Vishnu was able to convince Lobhasura about Gajanana's strength and the futility of opposing him. Lobhasura who also had a spiritual side realized that he did not have the power to stand before Ganesha. The demon surrendered before Gajanana without a fight.<br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Symbolically, the story indicates that those who are overpowered by the demon of greediness can overcome it by surrendering before Gajanana.

        <h1>15. Gokarna Mahabaleshwar</h1>

        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ravana,the king of lanka, was a great devotee of Shiva. He often went to Kailasa.There he worshipped Shiva with great devotion.Once,as usual, he had gone to Kailas. Lord Shiva was very pleased with his devotion."I am pleased with you" he told Ravana."ask for any boon. I shall grant it,"when all the world will end in the great floods,"said Ravana, "Lanka should be spared. That's the only boon I want! Shiva was little puzzled. Ravana had already proved troublesome to the gods. Having the boon granted he would trouble the gods still more. So what should be done? Shiva thought of a clever idea He gave Ravana a Shivalinga." take this Shivalinga,"Shiva told him, "wherever you put it down, it would stick fast there That place will be protected from the floods. If you wish to protect Lanka,make sure you put it down on reaching Lanka! Ravana was overjoyed. But shiva warned him, "hold it in both hands.If you leave it anywhere else it will stick to that spot,Then it will not be possible to remove it. So be careful with it!"Ravana eagerly started for Lanka. Meanwhile,the gods learnt of Shiva's boon to Ravana. They were horrified They went to Ganesha for help. They told him what had happened."please do something,God," they pleaded to Ganesha,"so that the Shivalinga does not reach Lanka. If it reaches there;Ravana would become more powerful."<br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ganesha thought for a moment. He had a bright idea,"all right,"he assured them a solution" I shall see that the Shivalinga does not reach Lanka."then Ganesha, in the disguise of a cowherd, stood in Ravana's path.Ravana had walked a long way, was tired and sweating.He wanted to wipe his sweat. But he could not do so;cause he had the heavy Shivalingain his hands. Just then Ravana saw the cowherd boystanding in his path.Behind him there was a river."hey boy! Come here." Ravana called out to the boy."What do you want?" the boy asked;without moving from where he stood."I am very thirsty,"replied Ravana. "Please hold this Linga for just a minute. Do not put it down. I wish to go to the river for a drink of water.I shall not take long.""All right!" said, Ganesha "but the Linga seems very heavy; if my hands get tired I shall call you three times If you don't come immediately back, then I shall put it down!" he warned."Don't worry! "Ravana said."I shall be quick."With a great relief he handed over the linga to the boy. Then he hurried to the river. And as soon as Ravana reached the river; the boy called out;"Ravana, Ravana, Ravana!" and quickly put the linga down.Immediately it stuck there.When Ravana came back from the river;there was no sign of the boy. And the linga had stuck to the ground. Ravana tried to pull it.But it did not move a bit.Yet,because of Ravana's great strength it lost the shape.It now resembles the ear of a cow. That is why it is known as Gokarna.The place became a famous place of pilgrimage. Even to-day we know it as Gokarna Mahabaleshwar.

        <h1>16. Is Lord Ganesh the complete God?</h1>

        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ganesha is the God of Ganas living in Lord Shiva's abode and Ganesha is subordinate to Lord Shiva in terms of divine power. Lord Shiva himself admits that he is caught in the cycle of birth and death as mentioned in Devi Bhagwat Mahapuran on Page 123. This proves that Ganesha also takes birth and dies since he is under Lord Shiva in terms of power.<br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He himself has not attained salvation (breaking free from the curse of life and death) therefore, he cannot grant salvation to any of his devotees. Hence, Lord Ganesha cannot be counted as the complete God.<br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Holy scriptures provide evidence that complete God (Aadi Ganesha) relieves souls from the vicious cycle of birth and rebirth. He is the provider of salvation. Pious Vedas provide information about the qualities of the complete God (Yajurved Adhyay 19 Mantra 25, 26).<br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Moving ahead, let us find out the answer to the most enduring question, if not Lord Ganesha then who is the complete God who provides salvation?. Holy scriptures have named him Aadi Ganesha? Aadi Purush, the immortal God who has created the entire universe. Let us know who is Aadi Ganesha and how can he be attained?<br><br>
        </p>

        <h1>17. Who is Aadi Ganesha?</h1>

        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To get complete benefit from these gods, all seekers must make pious Vedas and holy Shrimad Bhagawad Gita the base of their worship. Puranas are not the words of God. They are the personal experience of some deity/saint/sage. By reading Puranas we can understand the birth and death cycle but will remain devoid of getting true spiritual benefits from God. Pious Vedas and Gita are the words of God.<br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The worship that is done according to the holy scriptures by taking initiation from the enlightened saint ie. Param Akshar Brahm will help souls attain salvation. That Param Akshar Purush ie. Aadi Ganesha is the creator. He is the true spiritual leader. His name is Almighty KavirDev.<br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He plays the divine spectacle of an enlightened saint, imparts true knowledge to the devotees, provides true mantras with which salvation is attained and seekers go to that eternal world where they never come back to this deceased world of Brahm-Kaal. Only Aadi Ganesha is worthy to be worshipped. Now Let us understand what is the difference between Aadi Ganesha and Lord Ganesha.

        <h1>18. What is the difference between Aadi Ganesh and Lord Ganesh?</h1>

        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lord Ganesha is in the cycle of birth and rebirth is incapable of providing salvation to devotees. It is the supreme most God who alone is worth worshipping. He is Aadi Ganesha ie. Lord Kabir and no one else. On a soul's post-death journey, a soul has to pass through the barriers that have been created by deities to collect the loan of spiritual currency that we owe them in exchange for the worldly benefits that they provide us.<br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That spiritual currency is earned only by chanting the names of these deities that are given by a true saint.Gita Adhyay 7 Shlok 20 says that those who worship other deities are also in darkness. In Gita Adhyay 18 Shlok 66 the knowledge giver of Gita is directing Arjun to worship PurnBrahm (the supreme most God) and denounce worshipping him and all 33 crore deities under him.

        <h1>19. Who is a worshipable God-Aadi Ganesha or Lord Ganesha?</h1>

        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All of deities are respectable but only the supreme most Almighty Kabir should be worshipped. This is clear that Lord Ganesha himself is not liberated. Therefore, he cannot grant salvation and destroy the sins of his devotees. Whereas, Aadi Ganesha destroys sins and provides salvation to the true worshipper. The difference is evident. Only Aadi Ganesha is the provider of Salvation. He is the remover of obstacles.

        <h1>20. Celebration of Festivals- Ganesh Chaturthi and Ganesh Jayanti</h1>

        <p>
            <b>Ganesh Chaturthi</b><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the month of Bhadrapada (August / September), Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated in which Ganesha is honored for ten days. A Ganesha idol is worshipped and later immersed in the water on the last day.<br><br>

            <b>Ganesh Jayanti</b><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Ganesha's birthday) is also celebrated on the fourth day of the waxing moon in the month of Magha (January/February).<br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Note: This practice is not scriptures based and is simply worshipping according to one's desire. In Shrimad Bhagwat Gita Chapter 16 Verse 23, the knowledge giver of Gita Ji says that 'Oh Arjun, whoever denounces the way of worship as mentioned in the scriptures and worships according to his own desires gets no benefit be it a worldly desire or salvation'.<br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gita Chapter 9 Verse 23-24 does not support the worship of demigods since it is opposite to the scriptures which is the cause of their decline. In Gita Chapter 7 Verse 15 the giver of the knowledge of Gita says 'those equipped with demonic nature, lowest amongst men, evil-doers, foolish people do not even worship me'.<br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While mantras like 'Ganpati Bappa Morya' and 'Om Gam Ganapataye Namaha' and hymns like 'Jai Ganesh Deva' are commonly chanted and sung, nowhere in the scriptures is it suggested to do so. Morya was the name of a dedicated Ganesha devotee and in the commemoration of his devotion to Lord Ganesh, his name is suffixed to that of Lord Ganesh in the phrase 'Ganpati Bappa Morya'.<br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Such practices are useless. They cannot relieve souls from the cycle of birth and death. Gita Chapter 9 Verse 25-26 and Chapter 8 Verse 8-9-10 states that seekers attain the region of whichever God they worship. Like the worshipper of Lord Vishnu attains 'Vishnulo', a worshipper of Shiva attains Shivlok, a worshipper of Brahm-Kaal attains 'Brahmlok'. In Gita Ji chapter no 8 verse 16 it is made clear that after the attainment of Brahmlok all creatures come in birth and death, they are in recurrence.<br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hence, these arbitrary practices should be abandoned immediately. Devotees should do the right way of worship with which Ganesha provides benefits. So, what is the right way of worship of Lord Ganesh?<br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let us give you an overview of what is the Mantra for Attaining Benefits from Ganesha?
        </p>

        <h1>21. What is the mantra for attaining benefits from Ganesha?</h1>

        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The principal deities involved in the coordination of the world also hold a specific place in every human body where they reside in 'Chakras'. Our body has seven 'chakras' from the base of the spine ie. 'Muladhara' or the root chakra to the crown of the head called 'Trikuti'. Each Chakra is associated with a particular god. These chakras bloom only by chanting true mantras which are provided by an enlightened saint.
        </p>

        <h1>22. Placement of Lord Ganesha in Our Body Chakras</h1>

        <P>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let us share the placement of Lord Ganesha in our body. Ganesha lives in 'Mool Chakra' which is the very first chakra. It is situated in the sacral plexus at the base of the spine.<br><br>

            (1) Ganesha governs the Mool Chakra. This consists of four petals and is red in color. It is chanted 600 times.<br><br>

            (2) Above 'Mool Kamal' is 'Swad Kamal or Anahad Kamal' which is governed by 'Lord Brahma and Goddess Savitri'. This has six petals. It is chanted 6000 times.<br><br>

            (3) Above this, in Navel is the 'Nabhikamal' whose prime deities are Lord Vishnu and Goddess Laxmi. This has 8 petals. It is chanted 6000 times.<br><br>

            (4) Above this, Lord Shiva (Rudra) along with Goddess Parvati resides in the heart 'Hridaya Kamal' which has 12 petals. It is chanted 6000 times.<br><br>

            (5) Above 'Hridaya Kamal', Goddess Durga resides in 'Kanth Kamal'. This has 16 petals. It is chanted 1000 times.
