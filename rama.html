        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The epic Ramayana has been told in countless ways in several Indian and Southeast Asian languages and geographical locations. Nonetheless, the following are the two most well-known and significant versions:<br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>The Valmiki Ramayana: </b>Written by the sage Valmiki, this version is regarded as the oldest and original. It provides a thorough and objective narrative and is written in Sanskrit.<br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Tulsi Ramayana or Ramcharitmanas: </b>Written in the sixteenth century by the poet-saint Tulsidas. Composed in the Hindi dialect of Awadhi, a shortened and more concise rendition that emphasizes 
            Ram, Sita, and Lakshmana's emotional journey. This narrative is is poetic and aims for the reader to develop love for God.<br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; we have referred mostly to the Tulsidas's Ramayana.<br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The seven chapters that make up the Tulsidas's Ramayana are known as Kands (chapters or episodes); they are <b> Bal Kand, Ayodhya Kand, Aranya Kand, Kishkindha Kand, Sunder Kand, Lanka Kand, and Uttar Kand.</b>
            The story of Lord Ram is gradually revealed in these chapters, emphasizing the divine qualities of selfless love, sacrifice, patience, forgiveness, righteousness, commitment, and so forth.<br><br>

        <h1>1. The Bal Kand of Ramayana</h1>

        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The epic Ramayana's Bal Kand establishes the divine beginnings of Rama, his extraordinary attributes, and the dharma that forms the basis of his life.<br><br>

            <h2>Ram's Birth :</h2> <br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The chapter begins with salutations to Saraswati, the goddess of knowledge, and Ganesha, the remover of obstacles, invoking their blessings. The author, Tulsidas, presents the idea of Brahman, the ultimate reality, 
            from whom God Vishnu manifests.<br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lord Vishnu chooses to become an incarnation in human form because he is alarmed by the abundance of evil in the world. Brahma is approached by sage Narada and others, who implore him to disclose the form that Vishnu will become.<br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The story of Lord Vishnu's descent as Rama, the eldest son of King Dasharatha of Ayodhya, is told by Brahma. He talks about Ram's divine attributes, such as his courage, strength, compassion, and knowledge.<br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The story then moves to Ayodhya, a wealthy kingdom under the moral leadership of King Dasharatha. The king had four sons: Rama, Lakshmana (born to Sumitra), Bharata (born to Kaikeyi), and Shatrughna (born to Sumitra). 
            He has three wives: Kausalya, Kaikeyi, and Sumitra.<br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The celebrations of Ram's birth, which included lavish events and prophecies of his glory, are also covered in these set of dohas.<br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The story tells about Ram's and his brothers' extraordinary upbringing. Everyone in the kingdom adores Ram, and He is said to be gorgeous, clever, and kind.<br><br>

            <h2>Vishwamitra Yagya and Demon Encounters :</h2> <br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When the sage Vishwamitra arrives in Ayodhya, he begs Ram for assistance in defending his yagya (fire sacrifice) from demons that interfere with the ceremonies. Ram is quite happy to go with Vishwamitra, 
            even though he is still quite young. Lakshmana also accompanies them.<br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Along their path, they come face to face with the horrifying demon Tadaka, known for causing terror in the area. When Ram bravely vanquishes Tadaka, the people and sages are grateful.<br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When Ram and Lakshmana arrive at Vishwamitra's ashram, they encounter a number of obstacles from demons like Maricha and Subahu. Through his cleverness and prowess in battle, 
            Ram defeats the demons and ensures a successful completion of the yagya.<br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vishwamitra is impressed by Ram's courage and commitment, and he bestows upon him and Lakshman celestial weapons and divine knowledge, effectively preparing them for their forthcoming challenges.<br><br>

            <h2>Sita Swayamvara and Sita-Ram wedding :</h2> <br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ram and Lakshmana are brought to Janakpur, the kingdom of King Janaka, by Vishwamitra. Janaka is holding a swayamvara (self-choice of husband) for her beautiful and clever daughter Sita.<br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Indian kings and princes assemble to compete in a task that involves lifting and stringing an incredibly hefty bow. Many try, but Ram's great strength allows him to lift and string the bow with ease.<br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When Janaka realizes Ram as a divine personality, he is ecstatic and agrees to marry Sita. The chapter recounts the splendor of the marriage ritual that united Ram and Sita, a representation of the essence of devotion and love.<br><br>

            <h2>Significance of the Bal Kand :</h2> <br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Bal Kand demonstrates Ram's goodness, extraordinary abilities, and divine mission. Sita is also introduced in this chapter, emphasizing the significance of their relationship. The emphasis on dharma, duty, 
            and education foreshadows the difficulties Ram would encounter and his unyielding adherence to these values.

        <h1>2 - The Ayodhya Kand of Ramayana</h1>

        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Ayodhya Kand of Tulsidas' Ramcharitmanas sets the stage for Ram's epic journey. Ram, the personification of virtue and the presumed heir to the Ayodhya kingdom, encounters an unjust turn of events.<br><br>

            <h2>Preparations for the Coronation of Ram :</h2> <br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Overcome with happiness, King Dasharatha chooses to appoint Ram as his heir.
            The city is decked out for the coronation event, and people are looking forward to a golden age under Ram's rule as preparations get underway. But there's a cloud of doom hanging over the celebrations.<br><br>

            <h2>Kaikeyi's Two Boons :</h2> <br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Manthara, the maidservant of Kaikeyi, manipulates her and reminds her of the two boons granted by King Dashrath in the past. Driven by excessive love for her son Bharat, 
            Kaikeyi goes to Dashrath and insists on her two wishes being granted. Her son Bharat's coronation as king is the first boon; Ram's fourteen-year exile into forests is the second. Hearing these requests, King Dasharath collapses, 
            overcome by grief and bound by his oath. He begs Kaikeyi to change her mind but she is relentless. Dasharath becomes seriously ill because he is torn between his love for Ram and his obligation to his wife.<br><br>

            <h2>rama's Unflinching Determination :</h2> <br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When Ram finds out about the circumstances, he shows a great deal of acceptance and maturity. He puts the stability of the kingdom and his father's prestige ahead of his personal interests. 
            Despite the catastrophe that is happening, he doesn't lose his composure.<br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sita declares her steadfast support for Ram. Enraged by the injustice, Lakshman criticizes Ram's choice to go into exile without voicing any opposition.
            Ram emphasizes the value of following their father's instructions and preserving dharma (righteousness). He emphasizes that keeping their father's pledge is worth the tiny price of being exiled.<br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sita, unwilling to be separated from Ram, insists on accompanying him into exile. Lakshman, Ram's loyal brother, also chooses to join them.<br><br>

            <h2>Ram, Sita and Lakshman Head to the Forest :</h2> <br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With great sadness, King Dasharath bids farewell to Ram, Sita, and Lakshman. He expresses his deep regret and helplessness against Kaikeyi's demand.
            Ram consoles his devastated father, assuring him of his everlasting love in the midst of overwhelming sorrow.<br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The people of Ayodhya are unwilling to accept the forthcoming exodus. In an effort to persuade Ram to stay, they assure him of his legitimate right to the throne.Despite their pleas, 
            Ram remains resolute in his commitment to carry out his father's wishes. He encourages the residents of Ayodhya to maintain their loyalty to Bharat and acknowledges that his exile is a duty towards his father that he must fulfill.<br><br>

            <h2>Significance of The Ayodhya Kand of Ramayana :</h2> <br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Ayodhaya Kand establishes the core conflict of the Ramayana - the violation of dharma (righteousness) by Kaikeyi and the subsequent consequences. 
            It showcases Ram's righteousness, Sita's devotion, Lakshman's loyalty, Bharata's integrity and Dashrath's commitment to his words.<br><br>

            On the way to Panchavati, the mighty old eagle Jatayu greets Ram.<br><br>

            <h2>Encounter with Surpanakha, Sister of Ravan :</h2> <br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A demoness woman, Surpanakha, the sister of Ravana, was captivated by the matchless beauty of Ram. She attempted to seduce him. But when she failed to win either of the two princes, she turned to attack Sita. 
            Lakshmana cut off her nose and ears as a punishment. Hearing of this, her demon brother, Khara, organized an attack against the princes. Ram destroyed Khara and his huge army.<br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In order to avenge her humiliation, Surpanakha approached Ravana. She well knew of his weakness for women, and the wily demoness described the bewitching beauty of Sita. 
            Her intention to bring this beautiful  woman to him was foiled and she was mutilated. Ravan was aroused more by lust than by anger and he resolved to punish Ram by capturing Sita.<br><br>
